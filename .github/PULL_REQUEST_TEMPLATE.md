### Does any other open PR do the same thing?

<!--
**Please keep in mind that we apply the FIFO rule for PRs, so if your PR comes after an existing one and there is no compelling reason to merge it instead of the existing one it will be discarded!**

If another PR exists that has similar scope to yours, please specify why you opened yours.
This could be one of the following (but not limited to)

 - the previous PR is stalled, as it's really old and the author didn't continue working on it
 - there are conflicts with the `master` branch and the author didn't fix them
 - the PR doesn't apply anymore (please specify why)
 - my PR is better (please specify why)

# Bug report

<!--
ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

ðŸš¨ Please read the following carefully before opening a new issue. Your issue may
be closed if it doesn't provide the required pieces of information. ðŸš¨

We expect that it will take you about 30 minutes to produce a high-quality bug report.
While this may seem like a lot, putting care into issues helps us fix them faster.
For bug reports, it is REQUIRED to fill the rest of this template, or the issue will be closed.

Before submitting a new issue, please:

- Test using the latest release of the library, as maybe your bug has been already fixed.
- Check the existing [Issues](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps/issues?q=is%3Aissue) or on StackOverflow if there isn't a fix already for your problem.

Make sure you have followed the [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/react-community/react-native-maps/blob/master/docs/installation.md) too.

Still ready? Fill the template. ðŸ‘‡

    ***If your target is iOS , please specify if you are using AppleMaps or GoogleMaps
-->

`react-native info` output:

```bash
# paste your react, react-native, react-native-maps versions here
```

## Steps to reproduce

<!--
- You must provide a clear list of steps and code to reproduce the problem.
- Keep the code reproducing the bug as simple as possible, with the minimum amount of code required to reproduce the issue. See https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.
- If this library has additional install steps, describe them (e.g., pod install? jetify? etc).
- Either re-create the bug using the repository's example app or link to a GitHub repository with code that reproduces the bug.
- Explain the steps we need to take to reproduce the issue:
-->

1. â€¦
2. â€¦

Describe what you expected to happen:

<!--
  How did you expect your project to behave?
  Itâ€™s fine if youâ€™re not sure your understanding is correct.
  Just write down what you thought would happen.
-->

1. â€¦
2. â€¦

Describe what actually happens:

<!--
  Did something go wrong?
  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?
  Describe this section in detail, and attach screenshots if possible.
  Don't just say "it doesn't work"!
-->

1. â€¦
2. â€¦

## Reproducible sample code

<!--
  Please add minimal runnable repro as explained above so that the bug can be tested in isolation.
  If needed, you can also provide other samples: error messages / stack traces, screenshots, gifs, etc.

  Here are two ways to do it:

    * Create a new app using https://snack.expo.io/ and try to reproduce the issue in it.
      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or canâ€™t share the real code.

    * Or, copy your app and remove things until youâ€™re left with the minimal reproducible demo.
      This is useful for finding the root cause. You may then optionally create a Snack.

  Once youâ€™re done, copy and paste the link to the Snack or a public GitHub repository below:

```js
Insert sample code here

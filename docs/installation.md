# Installation

Install the library from npm:

```sh
npm install react-native-maps --save-exact
```

The library ships with platform native code that needs to be compiled together with React Native. This requires you to configure your build tools.

**Since React Native 0.60 and higher**, [autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md) makes the installation process simpler.

**Using React Native 0.59 or lower?** Please refer to [the old installation guide](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps/blob/5be836e1290457c4c7cefe83246ef532859c692d/docs/installation.md).

The actual map implementation depends on the platform. On Android, one has to use [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/), which in turn requires you to obtain an [API key for the Android SDK](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/signup).

On iOS, one can choose between Google Maps or the native [Apple Maps](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/) implementation.

When using Google Maps on iOS, you need also to obtain an [API key for the iOS SDK](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/get-api-key) and include the Google Maps library in your build. The native Apple Maps based implementation works out-of-the-box and is therefore simpler to use at the price of missing some of the features supported by the Google Maps backend.

> **WARNING**: Before you can start using the Google Maps Platform APIs and SDKs, you must sign up and create a [billing account](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started#create-billing-account)!

## Build configuration on iOS

### Using CocoaPods

After installing the npm package, we need to install the pod.

```sh
npx pod-install
```

### Set the usage description property

The app's `Info.plist` file must contain a `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` with a user-facing purpose string explaining clearly and completely why your app needs the location, otherwise Apple will reject your app submission.

### Enabling Google Maps

If you want to enable Google Maps on iOS, obtain the Google API key and edit your `AppDelegate.m` as follows:

```diff
+ #import <GoogleMaps/GoogleMaps.h>

@implementation AppDelegate
...

(BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
+  [GMSServices provideAPIKey:@"_YOUR_API_KEY_"]; // add this line using the api key obtained from Google Console
...
```

The `[GMSServices provideAPIKey]` should be the **first call** of the method.

Add the following to your Podfile above the `use_native_modules!` function and run `pod install` in the ios folder:

```ruby
# React Native Maps dependencies
rn_maps_path = '../node_modules/react-native-maps'
pod 'react-native-google-maps', :path => rn_maps_path
```

That's it, you made it! üëç

## Build configuration on Android

Ensure your build files match the following requirements:

1. **Configure Google Play Services**

**If you've defined _[project-wide properties](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/gradle-tips.html)_ (_recommended_) in your root `build.gradle`, this library will detect the presence of the following properties:**

```groovy
buildscript {...}
allprojects {...}

/**
 + Project-wide Gradle configuration properties
 */
ext {
    compileSdkVersion   = xxx
    targetSdkVersion    = xxx
    buildToolsVersion   = "xxx"
    minSdkVersion       = xxx
    supportLibVersion   = "xxx"
    playServicesVersion = "17.0.0" // or find latest version
    androidMapsUtilsVersion = "xxx"
}
```

or do

```groovy
buildscript {
    ext {
        buildToolsVersion = "xxx"
        minSdkVersion = xxx
        compileSdkVersion = xxx
        targetSdkVersion = xxx
        supportLibVersion = "xxx"
        playServicesVersion = "17.0.0" // or find latest version
        androidMapsUtilsVersion = "xxx"
    }
}
...
```

You can find the latest `playServicesVersion` by checking [https://developers.google.com/android/guides/releases](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/releases) and searching for `gms:play-services-maps:`

You can find the latest `androidMapsUtilsVersion` by checking [https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.maps.android/android-maps-utils](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.maps.android/android-maps-utils)

**If you do _not_ have _project-wide properties_ defined and have a different play-services version than the one included in this library, use the following instead (switch 17.0.0 and/or 17.2.1 for the desired versions):**

```groovy
...
dependencies {
   ...
   implementation(project(':react-native-maps')){
       exclude group: 'com.google.android.gms', module: 'play-services-base'
       exclude group: 'com.google.android.gms', module: 'play-services-maps'
   }
   implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-base:17.2.1'
   implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:17.0.0'
}
```

2. **Specify your Google Maps API key:**

Add your API key to your manifest file (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`):

```xml
<application>
   <!-- You will only need to add this meta-data tag, but make sure it's a child of application -->
   <meta-data
     android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
     android:value="Your Google maps API Key Here"/>

   <!-- You will also only need to add this uses-library tag -->
   <uses-library android:name="org.apache.http.legacy" android:required="false"/>
</application>
```

> Note: As shown above, `com.google.android.geo.API_KEY` is the
> recommended metadata name for the API key. A key with this name can be
> used to authenticate to multiple Google Maps-based APIs on the Android
> platform, including the Google Maps Android API. For backwards
> compatibility, the API also supports the name
> `com.google.android.maps.v2.API_KEY`. This legacy name allows
> authentication to the Android Maps API v2 only. An application can
> specify only one of the API key metadata names. If both are specified,
> the API throws an exception.

3. **Ensure that you have Google Play Services installed:**

- For the Genymotion emulator, you can follow [these instructions](https://www.genymotion.com/help/desktop/faq/#google-play-services).
- For a physical device you need to search on Google for 'Google Play
  Services'. There will be a link that takes you to the Play Store and
  from there you will see a button to update it (do not search within the
  Play Store).

That's it, you made it! :+1:

## Using the new Google Maps Renderer

As of version 18.0.0 of the Maps SDK for Android an upgraded map renderer is available. All of its improvements can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/renderer). The new renderer will become the default through a progressive rollout starting in June 2022 at the earliest.

To opt in to the new renderer add the following code in your entry file (e.g. App.js):

```javascript
import { enableLatestRenderer } from 'react-native-maps';

enableLatestRenderer();
```

`enableLatestRenderer` returns a promise (on android) specifying the map renderer being used, either `'LATEST' | 'LEGACY'`. It can be called at any point to get the renderer being used, but it won't change after the first map has been rendered.

Make sure to test your app thoroughly after enabling the new renderer, as it seems to cause some behavioural changes, e.g. [this](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps/pull/4055#issuecomment-1063358886).

## Troubleshooting

### The map background is blank (Google Maps)

If google logo/markers/polylines etc are displayed but the map
background is otherwise blank, this is likely an API key issue. Verify
your API keys and their restrictions. Ensure the native `provideAPIKey`
call is the first line of `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`.

Ensure also that the relevant Google APIs have been enabled for your
project from the URLs below:

- [Google Maps SDK Android](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/maps-android-backend.googleapis.com/)
- [Google Maps SDK iOS (if required)](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/maps-ios-backend.googleapis.com)

For reference, you may read the relevant issue reports: ([#118](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps/issues/118), [#176](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps/issues/176), [#684](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps/issues/684)).

### The map background is gray (Google Maps)

If you get grey screen on android device create google_maps_api.xml in android/app/src/main/res/values.

```xml
<resources>
  <string name="google_maps_key" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">(api key here)</string>
</resources>
```

### No map whatsoever

Ensure the map component and its container have viewport dimensions. An
example is below:

```jsx
import MapView, { PROVIDER_GOOGLE } from 'react-native-maps'; // remove PROVIDER_GOOGLE import if not using Google Maps
...
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
 container: {
   ...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject,
   height: 400,
   width: 400,
   justifyContent: 'flex-end',
   alignItems: 'center',
 },
 map: {
   ...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject,
 },
});

export default () => (
   <View style={styles.container}>
     <MapView
       provider={PROVIDER_GOOGLE} // remove if not using Google Maps
       style={styles.map}
       region={{
         latitude: 37.78825,
         longitude: -122.4324,
         latitudeDelta: 0.015,
         longitudeDelta: 0.0121,
       }}
     >
     </MapView>
   </View>
);
```

### Build issues with Google Maps iOS Utils (iOS)

If your XCode project uses dynamic frameworks (e.g. you also have Swift
code in your project), you cannot install `Google-Maps-iOS-Utils` with
CocoaPods. The issue and a workaround for it has been documented
[here](https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-ios-utils/blob/b721e95a500d0c9a4fd93738e83fc86c2a57ac89/Swift.md).

### Runtime errors on iOS (Apple Maps)

If you are trying to mount the map with the `GOOGLE_PROVIDER` during
runtime, but your build has been configured for the Apple Maps backend,
a runtime exception will be raised.

In addition, when using Apple Maps, some Google-only functionalities
have been disabled via runtime errors.

An exception will be raised if you try to use advanced features that
depend on the [Google Maps SDK for
iOS](https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-ios-utils). These include

- Making markers from KML files
- Heatmap rendering
- Marker clustering
- etc.

### Clearing caches

Run these commands to clean caches

```sh
watchman watch-del-all
npm cache clean

# Android, if you encounter `com.android.dex.DexException: Multiple dex files define Landroid/support/v7/appcompat/R$anim`, then clear build folder.
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
```

### When using Android studio

Make sure your Android studio is up to date and set up following the [React Native docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

In particular, the following packages have to be installed:

- Extras / Google Play services
- Extras / Google Repository
- Android 6.0 (API 23) / Google APIs Intel x86 Atom System Image Rev. 19
- Android SDK Build-tools 23.0.3

### No native module found exception on Android

Be sure to have `new MapsPackage()` in your `MainApplication.java` :

```java
import com.airbnb.android.react.maps.MapsPackage;
...
    @Override
    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
        return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
                new MainReactPackage(),
                new MapsPackage()
        );
    }
```

### Android emulator issues

- When starting Android emulator, make sure you have enabled `Wipe user data`.
- If you are using Android Virtual Devices (AVD), ensure that `Use Host GPU` is checked in the settings for your virtual device.
- If using an emulator and the only thing that shows up on the screen is
  the message: `[APPNAME] won't run without Google Play services which are not supported by your device.`, you need to change the emulator
  CPU/ABI setting to a system image that includes Google APIs. These may
  need to be downloaded from the Android SDK Manager first.

### Google Play Services conflicting issues with other modules

In case you have multiple modules using Google Play Services such as `react-native-onesignal`, Make sure to exclude all the Google Play Services dependencies from the modules and import all the Google Play Services dependencies for all the modules in the project-wide `build.gradle` file like the following example:

```groovy
  implementation(project(':react-native-onesignal')){
      exclude group: 'com.google.android.gms'
  }

  implementation(project(':react-native-maps')){
      exclude group: 'com.google.android.gms'
  }
  implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-base:12.0.1'
  implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-basement:12.0.1'
  implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:12.0.1'
  implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-tasks:12.0.1'
  implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:12.0.1'
```

### Trouble with Google Play services

- Make sure that your emulator has Google Play (Go to Android studio -> Virtual Devices -> Check that you have icon in "Play Store" column)
- Click to bottom dots icon in the emulator
- Go to Google Play Tab and click Update

### Android build error: "Program type already present"

If you **don't** use project-wide properties as per instructions above (not making changes to global android/build.gradle) and encounter at build time "Program type already present" error - add those lines to your android/app/build.gradle in the dependencies section:

```groovy
    dependencies {
    ...
    implementation "com.android.support:appcompat-v7:${rootProject.ext.supportLibVersion}"
    implementation "com.android.support:design:${rootProject.ext.supportLibVersion}"
    implementation "com.android.support:support-v4:${rootProject.ext.supportLibVersion}"
    }
```
